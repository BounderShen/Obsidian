Welcome to my Github page! I am a university student pursuing my degree. As a student, I love learning and exploring new things. I am particularly interested in computer science and programming, so I have shared some of my projects and code on Github. These projects cover a variety of topics, including web development, machine learning, data analysis, and more. I hope to showcase my skills and knowledge through these projects, and also to learn and grow from feedback from others. If you are interested in my projects, feel free to contact me anytime. I am very willing to communicate and share my experience with you.
